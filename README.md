  <h1>Object-oriented Kernel Hacking</h1>
  <p>Linux kernel workspace for term research in GSU's CSC 4320 (Operating Systems) course. Yet another attempt at marrying an intermediate runtime that has first-class support for object orientation with the operating system for great good.</p>

## Section Header Text
This kernel workspace is based on [this Gist](https://gist.github.com/chrisdone/02e165a0004be33734ac2334f215380e) by [Chris Done](https://gist.github.com/chrisdone), since I have not done much like this before. I'll work further into the proper way to do kernel work as I get better aquainted with the kernel source.
